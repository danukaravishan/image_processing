# image_processing
This is a folder locking system with face recognition embedded.
So you can lock folders with face identification.
In the initialization, you have to create a folder named "Training" and inside this folder, different folders for each one who will be using this.
Inside each folders, you have to put different face images as much as possible.

So the folder hierarchy should be as follows,
-Training
    - Name1
         -1.jpg
         -2.jpg
    - Name2
         -1.jpg
         -2.jpg
 You can use any names for "Name1, Name2, 1.jpg,2.jpg,.."

Further,
This tool can be used to traing your own classifire with set of training images and then use it to detect your own requirement.
